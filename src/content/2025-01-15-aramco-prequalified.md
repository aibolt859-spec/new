# Saher's multiphase technology pre-qualified by Saudi Aramco

**Saher is a technology company specializing in three-phase water-cut and multiphase flow metering solutions.** Our innovative technology is being validated by a growing number of energy companies worldwide, underscoring its reliability and effectiveness. 

## Historic Milestone Achievement

Notably, we are the **first company in the GCC** to have developed multiphase metering technology entirely within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This distinction has made Saudi Aramco a particularly valued partner for Saher.

Recently, we achieved a **historic milestone**: obtaining pre-qualification approval from Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil and gas company. This approval followed rigorous blind flow loop trials conducted at DNV's state-of-the-art, third-party test facility in the Netherlands.

## Rigorous Testing Process

During these trials, conducted in collaboration with Saudi Aramco and DNV, Saher's multiphase meter was tested with various combinations of oil, water, and gas flow rates. 

### Key Testing Details:
- **Testing Facility**: DNV's third-party facility in Netherlands  
- **Duration**: 5 days of comprehensive testing
- **Pressure**: Controlled at 500 psi
- **Fluids Used**: 
  - Natural gas
  - Synthetic oil (D-120)
  - Brine

Adhering to Saudi Aramco's stringent engineering procedure, the meter's performance was compared to highly accurate reference measurements from DNV's flow loop.

## Outstanding Results

The results demonstrated that **Saher's multiphase meter performed within specifications** in both oil- and water-continuous flow regions. Over five days of testing, detailed data analytics were applied, considering reference equipment measurement uncertainties.

> *"This pre-qualification represents not just a technical achievement, but validation of Saudi Arabia's capability to develop world-class energy technologies."*

## What This Means

This achievement positions Saher as a **trusted technology partner** for the world's most demanding energy applications and validates our commitment to:

- ✅ **Innovation Excellence** - Cutting-edge DMOR technology
- ✅ **Quality Assurance** - Rigorous third-party validation  
- ✅ **Local Development** - Made in Saudi Arabia for the world
- ✅ **Global Standards** - Meeting international specifications
